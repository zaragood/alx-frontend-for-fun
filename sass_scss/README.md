# Sass/SCSS Project

## Overview
This project is a starter template for working with Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) or SCSS (Sassy CSS) in web development. Sass/SCSS is a powerful extension of CSS that adds features like variables, nesting, and mixins to make styling more efficient and maintainable.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Compile Sass/SCSS:**  
   If you're using Sass, compile your Sass files to CSS using the Sass compiler. If you're using SCSS, you can compile SCSS directly to CSS.
   
   For example, with Sass:
   ```
   sass input.scss output.css
   ```

   With SCSS:
   ```
   sass input.scss:output.css
   ```

4. **Start developing:**  
   Once you've compiled your Sass/SCSS files to CSS, you can start developing your stylesheets. Make sure to link your CSS files to your HTML files to see the changes reflected in the browser.

## Features
- **Sass Variables:** Define variables to store reusable values like colors, font sizes, and spacing.
- **Nesting:** Nest CSS rules within one another, making your stylesheets more organized and easier to read.
- **Mixins:** Create reusable blocks of CSS that can be included in multiple places with different values.
- **Partials:** Break your stylesheets into smaller, more manageable files using partials and import them into a main stylesheet.
- **Functions:** Write custom functions to perform calculations or manipulate values in your stylesheets.
